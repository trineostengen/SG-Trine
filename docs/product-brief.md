Product Brief – Prioritize: Simple Task Manager
1. Purpose

Prioritize is a simple web application that allows a user to create and manage a basic to-do list.
The goal is to provide a clean and minimal tool where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them.
The project has been intentionally kept small to fit within the time and workload constraints.

2. Problem

Many people—especially students—need a simple way to keep track of tasks.
Most existing task managers are too advanced, too cluttered, or require accounts and extra features that are not necessary for basic daily use.

3. Solution Overview

Prioritize will be a minimalistic web app that includes:

Add a new task

Display all tasks in a list

Mark tasks as completed

Delete tasks

(Optional) Separate completed and active tasks

The focus is simplicity, clarity, and ease of use.

4. Target Users

Students

People who prefer minimal tools

Anyone who wants a quick and simple task list without extra features

5. Key Features (MVP)

Text input for adding tasks

Task list displayed on the page

Checkbox or button to mark a task as completed

Delete button for each task

Clean and simple visual layout

6. Non-goals

This project will not include:

User accounts or login

Database or cloud storage

Push notifications or reminders

Calendar functions

Complex UI design

This keeps the scope small and achievable.

7. Success Criteria

The project is considered successful if:

The user can add, complete, and delete tasks

The app runs in the browser with no setup required

AI agents are used to generate documentation and assist in writing code

I understand the basic development process well enough to explain it during the oral exam

8. Technology (simple)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: None (fully client-side)

AI: ChatGPT / Gemini / Claude for help with code and documentation
